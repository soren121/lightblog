# lightblog

Lightblog is a lightweight blogging platform designed especially with rich media 
in mind (think Tumblr.) It's written in PHP and uses SQLite 3, making it a great 
option for cheap/shared/low-resource web servers.

Lightblog is not currently recommended for production use.

### Runtime requirements

 * PHP 5.4+
   * pdo_sqlite enabled
   * curl enabled
   
   
PHP 5.6+ is **strongly** recommended.
