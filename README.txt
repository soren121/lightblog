Thank you for choosing LightBlog SVN!

Note that this is NOT a final release by any means,
and there may be many upon many bugs. SVN should
NEVER be installed on a production server under
any circumstances. There is always a possibility
that a revision may break critical components.

If you encounter any bugs, please be courteous and
report them at
http://code.google.com/p/lightblog/issues/entry

   server.

   LightBlog in in your web browser.
